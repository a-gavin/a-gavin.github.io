<!-- General commands -->
<!-- TODO: grep w/ regex -->

## Overview

This post serves to document useful Linux commands I use regularly or find useful. I intend to update it periodically as I find more and more useful commands.

Some command explanation is included with each, but Linux and command line experience is assumed.

## General Commands

These commands aren't necessarily Linux machine-specific, but they may come in handy when using one.

#### Run Command Every N Seconds

```Bash
# Prints 'Vale la pena' once every half second
$ watch -n 0.5 echo 'Vale la pena'
```

#### View File Contents as File Updates

```Bash
# The '-F' option may be useful as well. See 'man tail'
$ tail -f lanforge_log_1.txt
```

#### Search for File

```Bash
# The '.' here specifies to search in and all sub-directories of the '$CWD'
$ find . -name "\*.html"
./blog.html
./projects.html
```

#### Search for a Pattern (grep)

```Bash
# Search for a pattern in a file
# By default, this is not a regular expression pattern (see the '-E' flag)
$ grep "string" file.txt

# Search for a pattern in text read from a pipe (equivalent to above)
$ cat file.txt | grep "string"

# Search for multiple patterns in a file
$ grep -e "string1" -e "string2" file.txt

# Search for the pattern case-insensitive
$ grep -i "String" file.txt

# Print line number for every matched pattern
$ grep -i "String" file.txt

# Search for anything that doesn't match the specified pattern
$ grep -v "ath10k" dmesg.txt

# When piping data from a file that's actively being written to
# make sure to pass the '--line-buffered' argument. Otherwise,
# it may not match the specified pattern, even if it's written
# to the file
$ tail -F log_file.txt | grep --line-buffered "canary"

# Search for pattern in the output of text continuously read from a pipe
# (don't forget the '--line-buffered'!) then write the output to both
# the terminal (stdout) and a text file
$ journalctl -f | grep --line-buffered "mt7921" | tee out.txt
```

#### Login to a Remote System (ssh)

```Bash
# Login into a remote system over SSH
# Destination system is typically an IP address, hostname, or alias
ssh user@192.168.1.1

# Remote in using a non-standard port (default is 22)
# Note that the 'scp' command uses the '-P' option for port
ssh -p 2222 user@server

# Remote in using SSH URI (equivalent to previous command)
ssh ssh://user@server:2222

# Generate a new SSH public/private key pair
#
# This is used both for authentication purposes on a remote system
# and identifying a remote system to your system (~/.ssh/known_hosts)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519

# Copy an SSH public key to a remote system
#
# This allows you to login using the associated private key.
# The '-i' flag specifies the specific key to copy. Otherwise,
# the default is used (if no '.pub' specified, it's automatically added)
#
# You can also alternatively use the 'ssh' command to manually copy
# your public key into the 'known_hosts' file on the remote system,
# but this does it for you. Using 'scp':
#   cat .ssh/id_ed25519.pub | ssh user@server 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@server
```

<!-- System Administration: Non-Systemd -->

## System Administration: Non-Systemd

#### Show All Running Processes

**NOTE:** Systemd command `systemctl status` does similar but includes Cgroup-specific information as well.

```Bash
# Show all current processes running for current user
$ ps a
    PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
   2282 tty2     Sl+    0:00 /usr/libexec/gnome-session-binary --session=ubuntu
   5009 pts/0    Ss     0:00 zsh
   ...
```

```Bash
# Show all processes running on system
$ ps -e
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
      1 ?        00:00:01 systemd
      2 ?        00:00:00 kthreadd
      3 ?        00:00:00 rcu_gp
    ...
```

#### Get All PIDs of Program (if Running)

```Bash
# Get PIDs of Firefox program
$ pgrep firefox
4602
5086
```

#### Kill Running Process (USE CAUTION)

```Bash
# Kill process w/ PID 921. Default signal to send is 'TERM', so command is same as 'kill -s TERM'
# More immediate (and potentially harmful) is the 'KILL' signal.
$ kill 921
```

#### View Kernel Logs

```Bash
# Run with '-w' to follow in real time (like 'tail -f')
# The 'journalctl -k' command will also show kernel logs and is generally more flexible
$ sudo dmesg
```

<!-- TODO: systemctl commands (status, start/stop/restart, daemon-reload, enable/disable, edit)-->

#### Show Systemd Unit Status

```Bash
# The '.service' is optional if there are no other Systemd units w/ same name
# The bottom of the output is the same as would be output by 'journalctl -b 0 -u NetworkManager-wait-online'
$ systemctl status NetworkManager-wait-online.service

```

#### Manage and Configure Systemd Unit

**NOTE:** After editing a Systemd unit file, you must run `systemctl daemon-reload` for the changes to take effect.

The following assumes an example _system-level_ Systemd unit called `run_periodically.timer`. You can use the same commands for _user-level_ Systemd units like `pulseaudio.service`, e.g. `systemctl status --user pulseaudio.service`.

Active (enabled) systemd unit files are located in `/etc/systemd/system/` and `/etc/systemd/user/` directories.
When modifying systemd units, modify files in these directories. Other unit files exist on Linux systems, primarily in a `/usr/lib/systemd/` directory (depends on distribution). However, generally do not modify these as they are installed by your package manager and are meant as defaults.

```Bash
# Start the unit
$ sudo systemctl start run_periodically.timer

# Stop the unit
$ sudo systemctl stop run_periodically.timer

# Restart the unit
$ sudo systemctl restart run_periodically.timer

# Enable the unit (start automatically)
$ sudo systemctl enable run_periodically.timer

# Disable the unit (only starts manually)
$ sudo systemctl disable run_periodically.timer

# Mask the unit
# This prevents users from starting or enabling the unit
$ sudo systemctl mask run_periodically.timer

# Unmask the unit
# This undoes the effect of a 'systemctl mask'
$ sudo systemctl unmask run_periodically.timer

# Edit the unit (opens in editor specified in $EDITOR environment variable)
#
# You can also manually edit the unit file by finding it in '/etc/systemd/'.
# Do not edit the unit files in '/usr/lib/systemd/' or '/usr/lib64/systemd'.
# The exact directory will depend on your Linux distribution.
$ sudo systemctl disable run_periodically.timer

# Reload the unit files for all Systemd units
$ sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

#### View Service (Daemon) Logs

The following is a list of `journalctl` commands, each with separate options. Many of these may be combined to perform a specific task. For example, `journalctl -k -b 50 -r` will show the last 50 lines of kernel logs in reverse order (most recent to least recent).

Just as Systemd `systemctl` commands support both system-level and user-level units, `journalctl` does as well using the same `--user` argument.

```Bash
# Prints all log lines. Will be very long
$ journalctl

# Print only the last 100 log lines
$ journalctl -n 100

# Follow logs in real time (similar to 'tail -f')
# Can also substitute '--follow' for '-f'
$ journalctl -f

# Show logs in reverse order (most recent to least recent)
# Cannot use this option with '-f'
$ journalctl -r

# Show all logs that contain the provided pattern, here 'wlan0'
# Can also substitute the '--grep' option for '-g'
$ journalctl -g wlan0

# Only show logs for a specific ID, here 'test_program'.
# For example, the following would create a log message and
# tag it with the 'test_program' tag:
#   echo "This is a warning message" | systemd-cat -t test_program -p warning
#
# Note that this is different from the '-u' option
$ journalctl -t test_program

# Only show logs for a specific service, here, 'wpa_supplicant.service'
# Can also provide full Systemd unit name, e.g. here 'wpa_supplicant.service'
$ journalctl -u wpa_supplicant

# Show kernel logs (same output as 'dmesg' command)
# Can also substitute the '--dmesg' option for '-k'
#
# This is the same as 'journalctl -t kernel'
$ journalctl -k

# Only show logs for this boot (can use '-b' option instead of '--boot')
# When using the '--boot' and '-b' arguments, '0' and '-0' function the same (this boot)
$ journalctl --boot 0

# Only show logs for the last boot (can use '-b' option instead of '--boot')
$ journalctl --boot -1
```

<!-- Querying HW info -->

## Querying Hardware Information

#### Show System Hardware Information

It is recommended to run this command with root privileges to get the most detailed information.

For more CPU/NUMA-focused information in a pop-up GUI format, the `lstopo` command may prove useful. It has a text-only mode as well for non-GUI use cases.

```Bash
$ sudo lshw

<!-- Querying Network Information -->
<!-- TODO: nmap -->
<!-- TODO: Advanced networking section with 1q vlan, vrf -->

## Querying Network Information

**NOTE:** These commands are listed for diagnostic purposes.
You probably want to use Network Manager to configure your networking instead.
See the [next section](#managing-networking-network-manager) for more details.

Most Linux distributions run Network Manager to configure and manage networking nowadays. This is a common point of confusion, as many guides online reference older, network-scripts based network management and the deprecated `ifconfig` command.

It is possible to configure networking with variations of these commands. Generally, though, you'll almost always be better off using a tool like `NetworkManager` or `systemd-networkd`, unless you have a very specific use case.

For more information, see this [very detailed guide](https://axil.gitlab.io/iproute2/).

#### Show Network Interface Link-Layer Info</h3>

Displays interface status and MAC address. More detailed output is possible by
using the `-d` option (without the `-br` option).

**NOTE:** Take note of information to the right of the MAC addresses. 'UP' indicates interface is running. 'LOWER_UP' means the driver is functioning. For example, a non-configured but plugged in ethernet device may be 'DOWN' but 'LOWER_UP'. For Ethernet interfaces, 'NO-CARRIER' indicates that there is no signal on the wire (it's disconnected).

```Bash
# Shorthand shown. Full command would be 'ip link show', but the 'show' is optional.
$ ip -br l
lo               UNKNOWN        00:00:00:00:00:00 <LOOPBACK,UP,LOWER_UP>
enp2s0           DOWN           xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx <NO-CARRIER,BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP>
wlan0            UP             xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx <BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP>
```

#### Show Network Interface IP-Layer Info

These commands display IPv4 and IPv6 information in addition to other detailed information including interface status, MAC address, MTU, and interface routing table, among other things (some of which require `-d` option). More detailed output is possible by using the `-d` option (without the `-br` option).

```Bash
# Shorthand shown. Full command would be 'ip addr show', but the 'show' is optional.
$ ip -br a
lo               UNKNOWN        127.0.0.1/8 ::1/128
enp2s0           DOWN
wlan0            UP             192.168.0.234/24 fe80::xxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx/64

# Only show IPv4 information
$ ip -4 addr show

# Only show IPv6 information
$ ip -6 addr show
```

#### Show ARP Tables

```Bash
# Shorthand is 'ip n'
$ ip neigh
10.199.0.1 dev wlan0 lladdr 00:50:e8:04:57:ab REACHABLE

# Show specific interface's ARP table
$ ip neigh show dev wlan0
10.199.0.1 dev wlan0 lladdr 00:50:e8:04:57:ab REACHABLE
```

#### Show Routing Tables

```Bash
# Shorthand is 'ip r'. Will show all IPv4 routing tables.
# The '169.254.0.0/16' route is link-local IPv4 and is mostly default.
$ ip route
default via 10.199.0.1 dev wlan0 proto dhcp metric 600
10.199.0.0/20 dev wlan0 proto kernel scope link src 10.199.4.142 metric 600
169.254.0.0/16 dev wlan0 scope link metric 1000

# Show IPv6 routing tables only
$ ip -6 route
::1 dev lo proto kernel metric 256 pref medium
fe80::/64 dev wlan0 proto kernel metric 1024 pref medium

# Determine what route traffic will take for a specific address, here '8.8.8.8'
$ ip route get 8.8.8.8
8.8.8.8 via 10.199.0.1 dev wlan0 src 10.199.4.142 uid 1000
cache

# Show routes in routing table 10
$ ip route show table 10
```

#### Show Open Sockets (Existing Connections)

I typically use this as `ss -tulpn` and `grep` for what I want. If you run as root (e.g. with `sudo`), you will also see the program that is using the socket.

```Bash
# Main options are:
# '-u' for UDP
# '-t' for TCP
# '-p' display process (if have permission for given process)
# '-l' display only listening sockets
# '-a' display listening and established sockets (no '-a' or '-l' will only display established)
# '-n' do not attempt to resolve service name for port (to guarantee port num is printed)
$ sudo ss -tulpn
Netid  State   Recv-Q  Send-Q    Local Address:Port      Peer Address:Port  Process
udp    UNCONN  0       0         127.0.0.53%lo:53             0.0.0.0:*      users:(("systemd-resolve",pid=895,fd=13))
udp    UNCONN  0       0               0.0.0.0:631            0.0.0.0:*      users:(("cups-browsed",pid=1845,fd=7))
....
```

<!-- Managing Networking -->

## Managing Networking (Network Manager)

At a high level, Network Manager configures 'connections' which are established using a backing network interface, or in Network Manager terms, 'device'. These network interfaces are either managed or unmanaged from Network Manager's perspective.

Generally, most users will be fine with Network Manager configuring all of their
network interfaces, typically only WiFi and Ethernet (although Network Manager can do much more). There are times, though, where it is appropriate to have Network Manager [ignore specific interfaces](#set-device-management), for example, when doing [WiFi packet capture](@/blog/wifi-packet-capture.md).

This section details some of the most basic and more-useful (from my perspective) NetworkManager CLI commands. See `man nmcli-examples` for more examples and more advanced usage of Network Manager.

#### Show All Devices

Shows all Network Manager-tracked network devices, including both devices
that are managed and unmanaged by Network Manager.

```Bash
# Shorthand shown. Full command is 'nmcli device'
$ nmcli d
DEVICE         TYPE      STATE         CONNECTION
wlan0          wifi      disconnected  --
enp2s0         ethernet  unavailable   --
lo             loopback  unmanaged     --
```

#### Show All Connections

Shows both active and inactive connections.

Naming is typically the SSID (WiFi network name) for WiFi connections and 'Wired Connection X' for Ethernet connections.

When typing `nmcli connection` commands, active connections will tab complete, but inactive connections do not.

```Bash
# Shorthand shown. Full command is 'nmcli connection show'
$ nmcli c
NAME UUID TYPE DEVICE
SSID_NAME 2c5fc1ff-565f-495c-b6d3-59d5be6facde wifi wlan0
Wired Connection 1 167b3f3b-acb7-4ca2-9480-c41868641214 ethernet --
```

#### Show Specific Device Info

<!-- Link "Show Specific Connection Info" to the nmcli c s command -->

Only shows device-specific information. The command in used in
[Show Specific Connection Info](#show-specific-connection-info) will provide this and more information, assuming there is a connection which uses the device.

```Bash
# Shorthand shown. Full command is 'nmcli device show enp2s0'
$ nmcli device show enp2s0
GENERAL.DEVICE:                         enp2s0
GENERAL.TYPE:                           ethernet
GENERAL.HWADDR:                         xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx
GENERAL.MTU:                            1500
GENERAL.STATE:                          20 (unavailable)
GENERAL.CONNECTION:                     --
...
```

#### Show Specific Connection Info

```Bash
# Shorthand shown. Full command is 'nmcli connection show "Wired Connection 1"'
$ nmcli c show "Wired Connection 1"
connection.id:                          Wired Connection 1
connection.uuid:                        167b3f3b-acb7-4ca2-9480-c41868641214
connection.stable-id:                   --
connection.type:                        802-3-ethernet
connection.interface-name:              enp2s0
...
```

#### Set Device Management

```Bash
# Set device as 'unmanaged'
$ nmcli device set wlan0 managed false

# Set device as 'managed'
$ nmcli device set wlan0 managed true
```

#### Set DHCP for Connection

```Bash
# Sets connection 'SSID_NAME' to use DHCP for IPv4 address, subnet, and gateway
# Shorthand for 'nmcli connection modify'
$ nmcli c m SSID_NAME ipv4.method auto
```

#### Set Static IPv4 Info for Connection

```Bash
# Sets connection 'SSID_NAME' to use static IPv4 address, subnet, and gateway
# NOTE: The subnet mask is included in the address, here '/24'
# Shorthand for 'nmcli connection modify'
$ nmcli c m SSID_NAME \
    ipv4.method manual \
    ipv4.addresses 192.168.0.20/24 \
    ipv4.gateway 192.168.0.1
```

<!-- Querying WiFi Information -->

## Querying WiFi Information

**NOTE:** Most Linux systems use Network Manager to manage and configure networking, including WiFi. See the [Managing Networking](#managing-networking-network-manager) section for more details.

On Linux WiFi interfaces are created using a parent radio device, referred to as 'phys'. These radios come in a variety of form factors, including single radio, single phy and single radio, multi-phy. To view all system phys, run `ls /sys/class/ieee80211/`, which lists all `ieee80211` devices (WiFi phys). Supported interfaces, combinations, and settings depend on the radio firmware and associated Linux device driver. By default, a single WiFi interface is created per phy on system boot in 'managed' mode (WiFi station).

While most will be content with `NetworkManager` managing their WiFi interface settings, a more advanced user may find the `wpa_supplicant` and `hostapd` programs of interest. The program `wpa_supplicant` configures WiFi clients, whereas `hostapd` configures WiFi access points (APs, what most people refer to as a router). Both live under the `hostap` project and are widely used, including within tools like `NetworkManager` itself and within commercial APs as well. The configuration syntax is notoriously somewhat difficult, especially if you don't know the details of WiFi well.

#### Show WiFi Interface Link Information

**NOTE:** This command will only show meaningful output when the WiFi interface is connected (associated).

Includes AP MAC (if station), SSID, frequency, bandwidth, RSSI (if station), and phy rate (MCS),
among other things. Phy rate may or may not include NSS.

```Bash
# Can also run 'iw dev wlan0 link', but 'dev' is optional
# Anonymized MAC here is the AP's BSSID
$ iw wlan0 link
